# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) - an annual coding event with daily programming puzzles throughout December.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). The puzzles can be solved in any programming language and are designed for a variety of skill levels. Each day features two related puzzles, with the second unlocking after completing the first.

### Key Features
- 🌟 **Daily Puzzles**: New challenges released daily from December 1-25
- ⭐ **Star Collection**: Earn two stars per day by solving both parts
- 🏆 **Multiple Approaches**: Puzzles can be solved using any programming language
- 📚 **Learning Opportunity**: Great for practicing algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving
